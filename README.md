Food Spinner App 

Created in 2017 by Adnan Usman. I used Angular JS to create this little application as a learning project. 

It also helps when my wife asks me what she should cook :)

I plan to make more additions to it as I get more time.

For the time being I have the following features in mind:

1. If the system does not have any food, and someone clicks the button. It should tell them that the system is empty and to add food with a link.
2. The food should be editable once it has been entered into the system.
3. Be able to enter more than just the name of the food (optional, at this time it basically does what it is supposed to but this could be an additional feature).

If you have any suggestions to improve this even further, please share your ideas.
